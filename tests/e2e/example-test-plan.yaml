# Example E2E Test Plan for clai
#
# This file serves as both documentation and a reference implementation
# for the AI-assisted terminal testing framework.

# Schema Reference:
#   - tests: Array of test cases
#   - Each test has: name, shell, setup (optional), steps, expect
#   - Steps: type, press, wait, wait_for
#   - Expectations: screen_contains, screen_not_contains, screen_matches, etc.
