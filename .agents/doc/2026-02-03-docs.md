# Documentation Report: docs

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Project Type:** CODING

## Coverage
- Total documentable items: 183 exported functions (cmd/ + internal/)
- Documented: 117 (comment line immediately preceding, name-matching)
- Coverage: 63.9%

## Generated / Updated
- docs/ai-providers.md
- docs/cli-reference.md
- docs/configuration.md
- docs/features.md
- docs/getting-started.md
- docs/installation.md
- docs/quickstart.md
- docs/shell-integration.md
- docs/troubleshooting.md

## Gaps Found
- Shell hooks reference `clai voice`, `clai extract`, and `clai diagnose`, but those commands are not in the current CLI.
- Session‑aware history depends on a `claid` daemon binary; there is no build target in the current Makefile.

## Validation Issues (Fixed)
- Removed references to backtick voice mode and auto‑diagnosis in user docs.
- Corrected cache paths to `~/.cache/clai` for suggestion cache and Claude daemon files.
- Clarified that most `ai.*`, `client.*`, and `daemon.*` config keys are reserved/unwired today.
- Clarified distinction between `claid` (history daemon) and `clai daemon` (Claude CLI daemon).

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add a `claid` build/installation path or ship the binary in releases.
- [ ] Align shell hooks with available CLI commands (replace placeholders or add the missing commands).
