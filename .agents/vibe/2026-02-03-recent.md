# Vibe Report: recent

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Files Reviewed:** 23
**Grade:** A

## Summary
Reviewed recent Go, shell, and documentation changes plus newly added validation scripts. No functional bugs or security risks observed in the changes. Tool coverage is limited by missing linters/scanners, but manual review did not surface issues.

## Gate Decision
[x] PASS - 0 critical findings
[ ] BLOCK - 0 critical findings must be fixed

## Findings

### CRITICAL
- None.

### HIGH
- None.

### MEDIUM
- .agents/tooling/gitleaks-report.json: gitleaks reports 17 leaks, all in `.agents/ao/...` artifacts and sanitizer test fixtures (`internal/sanitize/*_test.go`). Treated as false positives for this change set; consider a `.gitleaksignore` if this remains noisy.

### LOW
- Toolchain coverage is partial (shellcheck/golangci-lint/gosec/semgrep/trivy not installed), so static analysis depth is limited.

## Aspects Summary
| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Semantic | OK |
| Security | OK (gitleaks noise triaged) |
| Quality | OK |
| Architecture | OK |
| Complexity | OK |
| Performance | OK |
| Slop | OK |
| Accessibility | N/A |
