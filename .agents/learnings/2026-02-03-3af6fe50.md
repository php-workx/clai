# Learning: Verify Reviewer Suggestions Before Implementing

**ID**: L1
**Category**: process
**Confidence**: high

## What We Learned

When processing code review feedback, each suggestion must be independently verified for technical correctness before implementation. Reviewers can propose changes that are false positives, already addressed, or architecturally inappropriate (e.g., suggesting a service change that doesn't fit the design).

## Why It Matters

Blindly implementing review feedback can introduce regressions or unnecessary complexity; skipping items that need architectural thought is better than shipping a wrong fix.

# Learning: SonarCloud API Severity Parameter Format

**ID**: L2
**Category**: debugging
**Confidence**: medium

## What We Learned

SonarCloud's API severity filter uses specific enum values (`INFO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `BLOCKER`) that differ from older SonarQube terminology (`CRITICAL`, `MAJOR`). The first attempt with legacy values fails silently, returning no filtered results.

## Why It Matters

External API parameter formats should be verified against current documentation rather than assumed from memory or older versions.
