## What We Learned

When reviewing complex specifications, running multiple judge agents in parallel with different perspectives (security, architecture, feasibility) and then synthesizing their findings produces higher quality reviews than a single-pass analysis.

## Why It Matters

Complex specs have interdependencies that benefit from multiple viewpoints examining them simultaneously, catching issues that a single reviewer would miss.
