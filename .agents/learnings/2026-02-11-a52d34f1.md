# Learning: Check existing code before specifying new abstractions

## What We Learned

When writing technical specs, always search the codebase for existing implementations before proposing new abstractions. The func spec's "claudemon" concept was already fully implemented as `internal/claude/daemon.go` with `claudeProcess`, `QueryFast()`, and Unix socket IPC — yet the initial tech spec proposed a new `ClaudemonClient` struct that duplicated this.

## Why It Matters

Specs that ignore existing code lead to unnecessary reimplementation and architectural confusion during development.
