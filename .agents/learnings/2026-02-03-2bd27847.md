# Learning: CLI Command Reorganization Requires Comprehensive Test Updates

**ID**: L1
**Category**: testing
**Confidence**: high

## What We Learned

When renaming or reorganizing CLI commands (e.g., renaming `voice` to `cmd`, hiding commands from `--help`), expect a cascade of test failures that reference old command names, flags, or output strings. Batch-updating tests against the new interface before running the suite saves significant debugging time.

## Why It Matters

Anticipating test breakage scope during CLI refactors prevents a slow trickle of fix-run-fix cycles and keeps momentum.

# Learning: User-Facing Error Message Format Matters Early

**ID**: L2
**Category**: process
**Confidence**: high

## What We Learned

Users have strong opinions on error message formatting (e.g., `Error: session not found (invalid-session-id)` vs generic patterns). Establishing the error format convention early and applying it consistently avoids rework when the user flags inconsistencies later.

## Why It Matters

Consistent, user-approved error formatting reduces feedback loops and keeps the CLI feeling polished.
