# Learning: Session Hygiene

**Date:** Starter Pack
**Tier:** 1 (Learning)

## Key Practices

1. **Always push before saying done**
   - Work that isn't pushed didn't happen
   - `git push` is the final step

2. **Run /post-mortem after epics**
   - Captures learnings for the flywheel
   - Creates patterns from experience

3. **Check Smart Connections before starting**
   - Search for prior art: `mcp__smart-connections-work__lookup`
   - Don't reinvent what exists

4. **Use beads for state**
   - `bd ready` shows unblocked work
   - `bd sync` commits issue changes
